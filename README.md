# Anti-Insult-system

This is a system to detect insults with json system in discord.py made by [**byAd12**](https://github.com/byAd12).

Im working to fix errors and adding files to make this easier. I hope this github helps you.

## How does it work?

The code makes it so that each person who runs the command ;anti_insult puts the server id in the json and puts if it is activated or deactivated
